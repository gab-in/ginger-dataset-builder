# Ethnicity Specific Database Builder Algorithm

#### *Welcome!* 
To run this algorithm, please ensure you have the required tools and the right versions of the algorithm's dependencies installed on your machine:
> **NOTE : IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT!!

##### Virtual Environment with python, in Linux:
```
python3.9 -m venv YourEnvironmentName
source YourEnvironmentName/bin/activate
```

##### Virtual Environment with python, in Window/MacOs:
```
python3.9 -m venv YourEnvironmentName
.\YourEnvironmentName\Scripts\Activate
```

---

You can automatically install all of the required components with pip, as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### After everything is ready, all you have to do is run the .py file from your terminal.
It may take several hours for the program to finish processing. If at any point you wish to stop, <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> will work just fine, without affecting the program's integrity.

Note that the algorithm is able to utilize your dedicated GPU if you graphics card supports CUDA, and the correct drivers are installed.
